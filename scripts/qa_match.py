"""
Q&A answer-bank matcher for the job-pipeline skill (Stage 3 — Prepare).

Before an LLM drafts an answer to a free-text / essay question on an
application form, the agent runs this script against the personal answer
bank (`state/qa_bank.json`). If a previously user-approved answer matches
the new question closely enough, the banked answer is reused verbatim —
the LLM never sees the question at all.

Matching is deliberately conservative (precision over recall): reusing a
WRONG answer on a job application is far worse than drafting fresh. A
candidate must pass ALL of:
  1. difflib sequence similarity >= threshold (default 0.75), AND
  2. content-word recall >= 0.6 (at least 60% of the banked question's
     content words appear in the new question), AND
  3. not a risky single-word substitution (e.g. earliest/latest,
     travel/relocate — near-identical strings, different meaning), AND
  4. scope check: a bank entry tagged "scope": "company" (company-specific
     answers like "why us") is only reused when --company matches the
     entry's company (case-insensitive). Untouched entries default to
     "generic" and are reusable anywhere.

Content words = alphanumeric tokens minus stopwords (generic question
boilerplate like "what is your", plus US-country phrasing "us"/"usa"/
"united states", which carries no discriminating value in these forms).

Non-interactive, stdlib-only, read-only: it never writes to the bank.
Exit code is always 0; missing/empty/malformed banks yield {"match": null}.

Usage:
    python3 qa_match.py --question "Why do you want to work here?" --company "Acme"
    python3 qa_match.py --bank /path/to/qa_bank.json --question "..." --threshold 0.8

Output (stdout, single JSON line):
    {"match": "<banked question>", "score": 0.93, "answer": "<approved answer>"}
    or
    {"match": null}
